## Description

The Note Taker is an application that runs on an Express.js server and provides users with a simple UI to input and save notes to a database.

This application uses the various technologies:

`HTML | CSS | Node.js | JavaScript | Express.js | JSON | JQuery`

## Installation

For installation, simply run `npm i` to install our dependencies.

Once our dependencies are installed successfully, we can proceed to run the application with `node server.js`

## Usage

On startup, the user is presented with the home screen. Click `Get Started` to access the note taker!

The user can now enter any given task in the empty input fields and save their tasks for future use!
